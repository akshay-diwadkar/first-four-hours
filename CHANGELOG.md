## [Unreleased]

First Four Hours starts its version history at 1.0.0. Earlier release history stays in the `akshay-diwadkar/skills` repository.

### Changed

- The repository, every skill, and every contract version the repository owns are now 1.0.0. A skill's version is also the version of every artifact, handoff, receipt, bundle, and state format it owns.
- A consumer accepts another minor or patch version of the same major and refuses any other version.

### Removed

- Support for artifacts, receipts, and state written under earlier internal versions. Reseal or regenerate them with the current skills.
